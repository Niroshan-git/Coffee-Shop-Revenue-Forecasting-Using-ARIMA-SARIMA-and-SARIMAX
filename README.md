# Coffee Shop Revenue Forecasting Using ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX

## üìã **Project Overview**
This project explores the use of time series forecasting models‚Äî**ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and **SARIMAX**‚Äîto predict the future revenue of a coffee shop. 
Accurate revenue forecasting is critical for optimizing inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies in the food and beverage industry. 

By analyzing historical revenue data, this project demonstrates:
- Identification of trends and seasonal patterns.
- Development of predictive models for short-term and long-term revenue forecasts.

## üéØ **Objectives**
1. To analyze the historical revenue of a coffee shop and detect underlying patterns.
2. To build and evaluate ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models for forecasting future revenue.
3. To provide actionable insights for improving the coffee shop's operational and strategic decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Methodology**

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Imported and cleaned historical revenue data.
- Checked for stationarity using statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
- Applied transformations (e.g., differencing) to make the time series stationary, as required by ARIMA-based models.

### **2. Model Development**
- **ARIMA**: Used for non-seasonal time series data, capturing trends and patterns from the historical data.
- **SARIMA**: Extended ARIMA by incorporating seasonality to improve accuracy.
- **SARIMAX**: Enhanced the forecast by including exogenous variables (external predictors) that influence revenue.

### **3. Model Evaluation**
- Evaluated models using metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Compared actual vs. predicted revenue visually to assess performance.

### **4. Forecasting**
- Generated future revenue forecasts to identify potential trends and seasonal peaks.

## üìä **Outcomes**

### **1. Revenue Trends and Seasonality**
- Detected consistent monthly and seasonal revenue patterns in the coffee shop's data.
- Identified potential seasonal peaks (e.g., holiday periods) where revenue tends to increase.

### **2. Model Comparison**
- **ARIMA**: Provided a solid baseline for forecasting but failed to capture seasonal variations effectively.
- **SARIMA**: Outperformed ARIMA by modeling seasonal patterns accurately.
- **SARIMAX**: Delivered the most accurate forecasts by incorporating exogenous variables like promotional campaigns.

### **3. Insights for the Coffee Shop**
- **Inventory Optimization**: Predicted sales peaks help in better stock planning.
- **Staffing Strategies**: Anticipating high-revenue periods enables efficient workforce allocation.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Seasonal forecasts guide promotional efforts during low-revenue months.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Pros and Cons of Models**

### **ARIMA**
- **Pros**: Simple and effective for non-seasonal data.
- **Cons**: Inadequate for seasonal patterns, requiring manual adjustments.

### **SARIMA**
- **Pros**: Captures seasonal trends effectively.
- **Cons**: Computationally intensive for large datasets.

### **SARIMAX**
- **Pros**: Incorporates external factors for better accuracy.
- **Cons**: Requires identifying and preprocessing relevant predictors.

## üåü **Future Work**
1. Extend the analysis by incorporating more external variables, such as weather data or competitor pricing.
2. Automate parameter selection using grid search for model optimization.
3. Apply similar methodologies to other datasets, such as customer footfall or product-level sales.
